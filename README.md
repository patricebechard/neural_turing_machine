# Neural Turing Machine

This is a PyTorch implementation of the Neural Turing Machine, a memory augmented RNN with attention proposed by [Graves *et al* (2014)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5401.pdf). The model was trained for the Copy task presented in the paper.

For more information on the model, please check the [excellent blog post](https://distill.pub/2016/augmented-rnns/) by Chris Olah and Shan Carter.

This repo still needs some clean up. I will try to provide a pre-trained model and a clean notebook for the reader to follow the various steps easily.
